    <h1>Discover the World of HTML </h1>
    <p>
        HTML is your gateway to building the digital world. With just a few simple tags, you can transform plain text into structured, interactive, and visually appealing web pages. It allows you to embed images, create forms, organize content, add links, and design layouts that bring ideas to life. Every element you see on a webpage—from headings and paragraphs to buttons and tables—begins with HTML. Explore the sections below to discover how each HTML element works and how they come together to shape a complete and dynamic webpage.

    <p>
        Next, we’ll explore each HTML element one by one to understand its role in building a webpage. 
    </p>
    <h3>Headings</h3>
    <p>
        HTML headings (h1–h6) are used to create titles and organize sections on a webpage, with h1 being the largest and h6 the smallest.
    </p>
    <h1>This is Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>This is Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>This is Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>This is Heading 6</h6>
    <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
    <p>
        HTML paragraphs are used to display blocks of text on a webpage. They help organize content into readable sections and automatically add spacing for better clarity.
        </p>
    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>
        HTML images are used to display pictures on a webpage. They help make content more attractive and informative by showing visuals along with text.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/html.jpg" alt="HTML Logo">
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>
        HTML links are used to connect one page to another. They allow users to navigate between webpages, websites, or any online resource with a simple click.
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a>
    <br>
    <h3>Lists</h3>
    <p>
        HTML lists allow you to organize information in a clear and structured way. Using unordered lists, you can display items with bullets, while ordered lists show items in a numbered sequence. Each item is placed inside a list item tag, making it easy to present steps, features, or grouped content neatly on a webpage.
    </p>
    <h4>Ordered List</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Orange</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Unordered List</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Rose</li>
        <li>Jasmin</li>
        <li>Sunflower</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Table</h3>
    <p>
        HTML tables are used to arrange data in rows and columns, making information easy to read and compare. Tables help present structured information such as schedules, reports, or lists in a clean, organized format.

     <h3>Forms</h3>
     <p>
        HTML forms are used to collect input from users on a webpage. They can include text fields, email inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, date pickers, and buttons.
